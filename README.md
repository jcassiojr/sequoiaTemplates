# Sequoia Keynote Templates

## Introduction
This repository is for the `Sequoia` Apple Keynote template, which I use for my courses as well as conference presentations and other lectures. The template is (now loosely) inspired by the `Modern Type` template that ships with the current version of Apple Keynote. However, I have significantly modified it to fit my own style of organizing and presenting information.

## Installation
To use `Sequoia`, you will need to download this repository and double-click on each of the Keynote template files (`.kth`). At the prompt, choose "Add to Theme Chooser". Before opening the template, you also need to install the required fonts. There are three "normal" fonts that can be obtained for free:

1. [Archivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo)
2. [Archivo Narrow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow)
3. [Computer Modern](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern)

Additionally, there are two icon sets that should be downloaded for free:

1. [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)
2. [FontAwesome v5 Free Version](https://fontawesome.com)

## Features

### Themes
`Sequoia` is comprised of six identical color schemes, each of which varies based on the primary and alternate color palettes employed. The primary color palette has a dark background with light fonts, while the alternate palette has a light background with dark fonts.

### Opinionated Organization
The templates have an opinionated approach to lecture organization that they are based on. Lectures, in general, should begin with a title slide that clearly introduces you and your topic. They should also have an agenda slide that lays out, in a linear fashion, what the lecture will cover. For teaching, after the agenda I lead with "Front Matter" that updates students on any administrative matters, due dates, and announcements. These are repeated, along with a review of the agenda, in a "Back Matter" section at the end of the lecture.
