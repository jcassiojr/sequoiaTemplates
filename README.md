# Sequoia Keynote Templates
This repository contains templates and example files (both keynote and .pdf) for my Sequoia Keynote Template. This is the template that I currently use for teaching and presenting research. It is based on the stock Modern Type template that ships with Keynote 6. The templates come in four colors - red, orange, green, and blue. Each color scheme has an alternate color scheme as well. The templates have been designed for high readability  as well as accessibility for audience members who may have color blindness. 


### About Christopher Prener, PhD
Chris is currently a faculty member in the [Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Saint Louis University](http://www.slu.edu/department-of-sociology-and-anthropology). He is an urban and medical sociologist with an interest in mixed methods research designs that incorporate spatial data. His research interests are focused on the way cities and healthcare systems, particular emergency medical systems, are organized. Chris uses mixed-methods research approaches in most of my projects, blending qualitative, statistical, and geo-spatial research techniques. He is particularly interested in the use of novel administrative datasets that are too large for manual editing (i.e. "big data") to address social science research questions.
